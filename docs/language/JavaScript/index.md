While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages,
many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles.
